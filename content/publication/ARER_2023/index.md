abstract: This paper examines how consumption of dairy milk is affected when households purchase plant-based milk substitutes.  Intuitively, one might think that these products are perfect substitutes, and any increase in the purchase of milk substitutes would have a one-to-one effect on purchases of dairy milk.  However, plant-based milk may be purchased by households that do not purchase any dairy milk (e.g., vegan households) or may be consumed in a different context than dairy milk (e.g., using almond milk instead of fruit juice in a smoothie).  I find that a 1-gallon increase in plant-based milk sales is associated with a 0.43â€“0.60 gallon reduction in dairy milk sales. Substitution between dairy and plant-based milk is strongest among households with high  expenditure on dairy milk.
