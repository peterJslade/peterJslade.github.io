I am an associate professor and the Canadian Canola Growers Association chair in agricultural policy in the Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of Saskatchewan.  I research two different areas: Canadian agricultural policy and the adoption of plant-based products/diets.  My current research projects, recent publications, and teaching are listed below.
